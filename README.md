# The Developer Guidelines

The developer Guidelines aim to help out anyone who wants to contribute to Icinga.
For now, they are mainly a collection of material we already have in different documentations.
We want to eventually move all of the development relevant information and documentation here and leave the project documentations be user documentation.
