## Basics and Technologies

Before deep diving into writing code, we should explain necessary basics and technologies:

* HTTP protocol
    * This may include an explanation for our special HTTP headers and their handling, but there may also be an extra chapter for this
* Cookies
    * This may include information about our cookies and their handling, but there may also be an extra chapter for this
* Ajax
* MVC
* JavaScript and CSS delivery
* X-column layout
* URL handling
* Form redirects
* Flow of requests, i.e. first request is a full-page load including the delivery of JavaScript and CSS and every subsequent request is AJAX
* Convention over configuration
* Translation
* Docker
