# Developer Guide: New-IcingaCheckPackage

Below you will find a list of functions and detailed descriptions including use cases for Cmdlets and features the PowerShell Framework provides.

| Type | Return Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cmdlet | PowerShell Object | Check Object containing other check objects |

The `IcingaCheckPackage` is the first step to take to write more advanced checks. A `IcingaCheckPackage` offers the possibility to build a check containing varius `IcingaChecks`. Just like the `IcingaCheck`, the `IcingaCheckPackage` also provides a bunch of internal commands within the PowerShell Object to analyse a value and get the Icinga result `Ok`, `Warning`, `Critical`. In this case the result of the check package is based on the result of the logical conjunction between added `IcingaChecks` within the `IcingaCheckPackage`

It will be used like in this example:

```powershell
$IcingaPackage = New-IcingaCheckPackage -Name 'My Package' -OperatorAnd;
```

## Arguments

| Argument           | Input     | Mandatory | Description |
| ---                | ---       | ---       | ---         |
| Name               | String    |  *        | The unique name of each package within a plugin. Will be displayed in the check output.  |
| OperatorAnd        | Switch    |           | Every added check/package requires to return Ok for this package to be Ok |
| OperatorOr         | Switch    |           | One added check/package requires to return Ok for this package to be Ok |
| OperatorNone       | Switch    |           | None of added check/package has to return Ok for this package to be Ok |
| OperatorMin        | Int       |           | Minimum of `n` added checks/packages requires to return Ok for this package to be Ok |
| OperatorMax        | Int       |           | Maximum of `n` added checks/packages requires to return Ok for this package to be Ok |
| Checks             | Array     |           | Array of checks to be added to the check package |
| Verbose            | int       |           | Defines the level of output detail from 0 lowest to 3 highest detail |
| IgnoreEmptyPackage | Switch    |           | By default a check package will return `Unknown` in case no checks are assigned. Setting this argument will ignore this and return `Ok` instead
| Hidden             | Switch    |           | If set, the check package doesn't generate output |

### Examples

#### Example 1

Simple check package which requires both checks to be okay. Two simple check items with two different values in this case `37` and `18`. Based on the thresholds set, `20` for `warning` and `35` for `critical`, one of the checks will be `ok`, while the other enters the `critical` state. Both get added to an check package, which handles them with a logical AND conjunction. Thereby the IcingaPackage enters the `critical state`.

```powershell
$IcingaCheck1 = New-IcingaCheck -Name 'My Check 1' -Value 37 -Unit '%';
$IcingaCheck1.WarnOutOfRange(20).CritOutOfRange(35) | Out-Null;

$IcingaCheck2 = New-IcingaCheck -Name 'My Check 2' -Value 18 -Unit '%';
$IcingaCheck2.WarnOutOfRange(20).CritOutOfRange(35) | Out-Null;

$IcingaPackage = New-IcingaCheckPackage -Name 'My Package' -OperatorAnd;
$IcingaPackage.AddCheck($IcingaCheck1);
$IcingaPackage.AddCheck($IcingaCheck2);
```
