## <a id="contributing-branches"></a> Branches

Choosing a proper name for a branch helps us identify its purpose and possibly
find an associated bug or feature.
Generally a branch name should include a topic such as `bugfix` or `feature` followed
by a description and an issue number if applicable. Branches should have only changes
relevant to a specific issue.

```bash
git checkout -b bugfix/service-template-typo-1234
git checkout -b feature/config-handling-1235
```
