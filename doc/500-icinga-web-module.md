# Icinga Web Module <a id="icinga-web-module"></a>

## Write your own Icinga Web 2 module

Welcome! Glad to see that you are here to write your first Icinga Web module. Icinga Web makes getting started as easy as possible. Over the next few hours we will discover how fun tinkering with Icinga Web 2 can be, with a series of practical examples.

## Should I really? Why?

Absolutely, why not? It's incredibly straightforward, and Icinga is 100% free, open source software with a great community. Icinga Web 2 is a stable, easy to understand and future-proof platform. So exactly what you want to base your own projects on.

## Only for monitoring?

Not at all! Sure, monitoring is where Icinga Web originates and it's what it excels at. Since monitoring systems communicate with all sorts of systems in and outside of ones data center anyway, we found it to be the most natural thing to have the frontend behave in a similar fashion.

Icinga Web is a modular framework, which aims to make integration of third-party software as easy as possible. At the same time, true to the Open Source concept, we also want to make it easy for third parties to use Icinga logic, as conveniently as possible, in their own projects.

Whether it is about integrating third-party systems, the connection of a CMDB or the visualization of complex systems to supplement popular check-plugins - there is no limit to what you can do.

## But I'm not a PHP/JavaScript/HTML5 hacker

No problem. Of course, it doesn't hurt to know the basics of web development. This way or the other - Icinga Web allows you to write your own modules with our without in-depth PHP/HTML/CSS knowledge.
