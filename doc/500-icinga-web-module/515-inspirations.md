So, looks like you made it! Now you learned the basics on module development for Icinga Web 2 - for the rest: just try it out yourself! You can get some more help by looking at existing modules on [Icinga Exchange](https://exchange.icinga.com/) and for inspiration you can also come to our [Icinga Events](https://icinga.com/events/)!

Have fun tinkering and happy hacking with Icinga Web 2!!!
